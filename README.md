# Recently Played Songs Spotify ETL

A small, quick, and dirty ETL project created using Python, Postgres, and Spotify API.

First project as a foray into data engineering. 

Also first time using Python for something other than a project for my master's, hooray!

## TODO:

- Add in Airflow & Dockerize everything
